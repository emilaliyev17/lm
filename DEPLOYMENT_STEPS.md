# 🚀 Universal Invoice Search - Deployment Steps

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
cd "/Users/emil.aliyev/My Projects/LM/loan-management-system"
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py migrate
```

This creates 5 database indexes for fast invoice searching.

### Step 2: Start Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 3: Test the Search
1. Open browser: http://localhost:8000/api/loans/
2. You'll see a search bar at the top
3. Try searching:
   - Card number: "LC"
   - Borrower name: (any borrower in your system)
   - Invoice number: "SD" or any invoice you have

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend
- ✅ Database indexes on 5 invoice fields
- ✅ Search API endpoint: `/api/loans/search/`
- ✅ Searches across 7 data types (card, borrower, 5 invoice types)
- ✅ Minimum 2 characters validation
- ✅ Performance logging
- ✅ Security (XSS, SQL injection protected)

### Frontend
- ✅ Search input on dashboard
- ✅ Real-time autocomplete dropdown
- ✅ 300ms debounce (prevents excessive API calls)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Color-coded badges for different types
- ✅ Click to navigate to loan detail
- ✅ Mobile responsive

## 🎯 Invoice Types Searched

| # | Field | Example | Badge Color |
|---|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | LoanCard.advanced_loan_invoice | "INV-12345" | Purple 📄 |
| 2 | SettlementCharge.invoice_number | "SD 2256" | Blue 💰 |
| 3 | Draw.invoice_number | "DRAW-001" | Orange 📦 |
| 4 | InterestSchedule.invoice_number | "QBO-5678" | Green 📅 |
| 5 | InterestPayment.invoice_number | (legacy) | Gray 🕐 |

Plus: Card numbers and Borrower names

## 📊 Expected Performance

- Search time: **< 50ms** with indexes
- Works smoothly with 500+ loans
- Handles 4,000+ invoice records

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Migration fails?
Check PostgreSQL connection in settings.py

### Search doesn't appear?
Clear browser cache and refresh page

### No results but data exists?
Make sure migration ran successfully:
```bash
python manage.py showmigrations loans
```

### Search is slow?
Check indexes were created:
```bash
python manage.py dbshell
\di loans_*
```
